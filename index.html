                  <p>It's easy to become very self-critical when you're an actor. Then you get critiqued by the critics.
                    Whether you agree with them or not, people are passing judgment on you.</p>

                  <p>Born in Beirut, Lebanon on September 2, 1964, the son of Patricia (née Taylor), an English costume
                    designer and performer from Essex, and Samuel Nowlin Reeves, Jr., an American man from Hawaii.</p>

                  <p><strong>1980</strong></p>
                  <p>Following this film's critical success, I spent the late 1980s appearing in a number of movies
                    aimed at teenage audiences, including Permanent Record, and the unexpectedly successful 1989 comedy,
                    Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, along with its 1991 sequel, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey.</p>

                  <p><strong>1980</strong></p>
                  <p>I began my acting career at the age of nine, appearing in a theatre production of Damn Yankees. At
                    15, I played Mercutio in a stage production of Romeo and Juliet at the Leah Posluns Theatre. I
                    dropped out of high school when I was 17. Then obtained a green card through my American stepfather
                    and moved to Los Angeles three years later. I lived with my ex-stepfather, Paul Aaron, who was a
                    stage and television director. I made my screen acting debut in an episode of Hangin' In. In the
                    early 1980s, I appeared in commercials (including one for Coca-Cola), short films including the NFB
                    drama One Step Away and stage work such as Brad Fraser's cult hit Wolfboy in Toronto.</p>

                  <p><strong>1986</strong></p>
                  <p>My first studio movie appearance was Youngblood (1986) in which I played a Québécois goalie.</p>
                  <br>

                <li>
                  <p><strong>1986</strong></p>
                  <p>After a few minor roles, Reeves received a sizeable role in the 1986 drama film River's Edge, which
                    depicted how a murder affected a group of teens.</p>
                  <br>

                <li>
                  <p><strong>1990</strong></p>
                  <p>During the early 1990s, I started to break out of my teen-film period.</p>
                  <br>

                <li>
                  <p><strong>1991</strong></p>
                  <p>I was involved in various lower-budget independent films, including the well-received 1991 film, My
                    Own Private Idaho with River Phoenix.</p>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>1992</strong></p>
                  <p>Appeared in high-budget action films like Point Break, for which I won MTV's "Most Desirable Male"
                    award in 1992.</p>
                  <br>

                <li>
                  <p><strong>1994</strong></p>
                  <p>In 1994 career reached a new high as a result of my starring role in the action film Speed. My
                    casting in the film was controversial, since, except for Point Break, I was primarily known for
                    comedies and indie dramas. I had never been the sole headliner on a film. The summer action film had
                    a fairly large budget and was helmed by novice cinematographer-turned-director Jan de Bont. My
                    career choices after Speed were eclectic: despite successes, I continued to accept supporting roles
                    and appear in experimental films. I scored a hit with a romantic lead role in A Walk in the Clouds.
                  </p>

                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>1995</strong></p>
                  <p>Made news by refusing to take part in Speed 2: Cruise Control – despite the offered $11 million
                    paycheck, which would have been my largest to date – in favour of touring with my band and playing
                    the title role in a 1995 Manitoba Theatre Centre production of Hamlet in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
                    However, I choosing after A Walk in the Clouds failed with critics and audiences. Big-budget films
                    such as the sci-fi action film Johnny Mnemonic and the action-thriller Chain Reaction were
                    critically panned and failed at the box office, while indie films like Feeling Minnesota were also
                    critical failures. I finally started to climb out of my career low after starring in the
                    horror-drama The Devil's Advocate alongside Al Pacino and Charlize Theron. I took a paycut of $1
                    million for The Devil's Advocate so that Pacino would be cast, and later took a 90 per cent paycut
                    for the less successful The Replacements to guarantee the casting of Gene Hackman. The Devil's
                    Advocate did well at the box office and garnered good reviews.</p>

                  <p><strong>1999</strong></p>
                  <p>The 1999 science fiction-action hit The Matrix, a film in which I had a starring role, was a box
                    office success and attracted positive reviews.</p>

                  <p>Entitled to British citizenship through my English mother. I hold Canadian citizenship by
                    naturalization. I grew up as a Canadian and identify as such, and hold an American green card. My
                    biological father was born in the United States but I required a green card because I was not

                    Syme-Reeves, who was stillborn. The strain put on their relationship by their grief resulted in my
                    and Syme's breakup several weeks later.</p>

                  <p>On April 2, 2001, Syme was driving alone on Los Angeles' Cahuenga Boulevard when she sideswiped
                    three parked cars, rolled over several times and was thrown from the car. Authorities believed she
                    died instantly. She reportedly was being treated for depression and taking two prescription drugs,
                    which police found in her car. I sought "peace and time to deal with this", according to my friend
                    Bret Domrose, a guitarist in Reeves's alternative rock band Dogstar.</p>

                  <p>In between the first Matrix film and its sequels, I received positive reviews for my portrayal of
                    an abusive husband in The Gift. Aside from The Gift, I appeared in several films that received
                    mostly negative reviews and unimpressive box office grosses, including The Watcher, Sweet November,
                    and The Replacements. However, the two Matrix sequels, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix
                    Revolutions, along with Something's Gotta Give and the 2005 horror-action film, Constantine, were
                    box office successes and brought me back into the public spotlight.</p>

                  <p>Beginning in 2008, I began pre-production on his directorial debut, Man of Tai Chi. The film is a
                    multilingual narrative, partly inspired by the life of his friend, stuntman Tiger Chen. Filming
                    occurred on mainland China and Hong Kong.</p>

                    In 2010, my image became an internet meme after photos of me, seemingly depressed while sitting on a
                    park bench eating alone, were posted to a 4chan forum. The images were soon distributed via several
                    blogs and news sites. These pictures led to the "Keanu is Sad" or "Sad Keanu" meme being spread on
                    internet forums.</p>

                  <p>During Man of Tai Chi's five years of scripting and production, acted in several B movies with lead
                    roles as Henry in 2010's Henry's Crime and John in 2012's Generation Um.... During that time, also
                    played Kai in the critically panned 47 Ronin. Critics widely attribute the film's poor performance
                    to its direction, pacing, focus on special effects, and editing.</p>

                  <p>In 2011, produced the documentary Side by Side about the supplanting of photo-chemical film by
                    digital camera technology; I interviewed several celebrated directors including James Cameron,
                    Martin Scorsese, and Christopher Nolan.</p>

                    Festival and Cannes Film Festival. The work was awarded in Beijing and praised by recognized
                    director of action genre films, John Woo. I continued acting while exploring other forms of
                    artistry.</p>

                  <p>I further elaborated on the film in December 2013 during a taping of NBC's The Today Show. "I'm
                    open to the idea of that...I think it's pretty surreal, playing 'Bill & Ted' at 50. But we have a
                    good story in that. You can see the life and joy in those characters, and I think the world can
                    always use some life and joy."
                    I has been linked to the maritime romance The Modern Ocean.</p>

                    had a cameo in the Jordan Peele/Keegan-Michael Key action comedy Keanu where I voiced the eponymous
                    kitten. Keanu director Peter Atencio revealed that the filmmakers had contacted my management about
                    me appearing in the film, who declined on his behalf. When my sister showed me the trailer, I
                    contacted the filmmakers directly about appearing in the film. As the film had been mostly
                    completed, they decided to have a scene where I voice the kitten.</p>
